# transcriptsExploration

This project is an exploration of text from medical transcripts. The goal of the project was to create some classification models to identify what medical specialty referred a particular transcript. Since there were 40 different classes, I selected the 4 specialties with the most number of transcripts. 

This project was created to improve my NLP, tidymodels, tidyverse, and R skills.

The csv file, "mtsamples.csv" was obtained from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tboyle10/medicaltranscriptions).
